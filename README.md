Abstract
The company that needs a database application is a temporary hire company that places candidates in jobs, also giving them the opportunity to raise their skills as a better candidate with given courses in given sessions that they can take. One that also shows if they have any job history, if any at all and displaying.  They would like all this information housed in an easily updatable format.

The application
This application is important to be easily updatable and accessible because if one candidate were to change their name there might be some issue with integrity that is why we use IDs instead. Also, candidates can go to courses, which needs to be updated and added on constantly. Lastly the sessions and available courses will always be changing. This company needs a database that will be heavily updated and worked with. Which is what this application is and very user-friendly format that works with Excel if there is no employee with SQL experience.
