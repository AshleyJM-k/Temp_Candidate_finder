A database built with MySQL Workbench and Microsoft Azure for a temporary employment company that is specializes with candidates in the technology field.
This database was built with utilization and the companies needs to be met with ease of access, easy adding, modifying, and removing with high integrity, 
unique data input to reduce errors or future issues. 
The top-down process started, creating the business rules followed by the tables (all inside the images file) as well as normalization for when needed. 
The query was then started on MySQL Workbench and swapped over to Microsoft Azure for a different experience and a minor connection (licensing error on my side)
between MySQL and Microsoft Excel.
